# Tic-tac-toe
# This is a two player Tic Tac Toe game simulator programmed using Python 3 and its Turtle Graphics module.
# This can take inputs (of coordinates in the tic tae toe grid) from the players, verify the inputs, and draw the crosses or circles accordingly using the Turtle module.
# In the end, it will declare the winner, or declare a draw if there isn't any.
# The coordinates are named in this way: A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3. Columns are named 1, 2, 3 and rows are named A, B, C.
